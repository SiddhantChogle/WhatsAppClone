# WhatsApp Clone

This is one of my initial projects in flutter. The goal was to learn and practice the basics of flutter. I realised that **cloning** a software application is the best way to learn with motivation. A leap of faith!

## Description

Created the UI of most popular messaging app Whatsapp. Replicated the UI and some functionalities as close as possible.

## Tech Stack and Others
